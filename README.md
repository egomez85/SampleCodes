# SampleCodes

Sample Code Repo (Added for [Gigster](https://gigster.com/talent/) purposes)

# Comments

All my code changes are not in public repos (Belongs to the clients I have worked on) and it is not ethical to upload them on a public repo for demo purposes. But I can write any sample code from what I am expert on (Spring microservice with Angular Front) if required for demo purposes and to validate my skills. I can add them into this repo without any issues. 

Please let me know if you have anything in mind and I can develop it to prove my tech skills.
